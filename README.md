# Ball Hitting Robot
CS 391R course project @ UT in Fall 2022
Jeff Bonyun, Tyler Ingebrand, and Frank Regal

This project contains a ball hitting robot for our CS 391R class project. 
It contains the source code for the environment and uses stable baselines3 for the RL implementations.
The MDP is based on robosuite, and provides either a low dimensional or high dimensional state space, depending on user preference.

See below for numerous examples of trained policies.
